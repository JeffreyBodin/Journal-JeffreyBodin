Is ^ basically switcharoo of my league fileSys for permanence.

Honestly encourage others to do the same. Its an imporant and rarely utililzed featureset.

That riot games (small indie dev studio) has really well constructed for us. These matches matter.

They have to me. I know they do to others as well.

So why not just create a habit to literally save ALL of the actual files in the cloud.

ONEDRIVE has a cache feature for deleted items. 

Alongside likelyhood of using Win10 ('Properties') to un-modifiy items following their uploads. 

So you can probably find a solution that fits yourself. Even if the league of legends client auto-matically forcePurges past a certain date of "saved" replays. You will still have them.

Still remaining able to use the 'League of Legends' file system on your machine. 

To find the correctly targeting executable to then open without using the client. Your "offline" saved game.

For your viewship and perpetual archival. 

Ie YOUR OWN PROOF OF WORK. 

Ie YOUR OWN VALIDATION or PROOF OF GOOD FAITH COMPETITION && PLAY.
