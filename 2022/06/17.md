```js
/*
# 2022-06-17 ebay - pending - Lolita Maid Uniform (Open Lace Corset) (E set)

`// note`

- -> is a size '6'
  - by the us charting
  - by my subtraction
  - of the Etsy charting for womens clothes
  - of the subtration regarding smallest empiricised numeral -- of the highest maximum empiricisesd numeral
- ie 
  ```js
  'numOfWomenDressSize' === () => {
    'numOfWomenDressSizeFloor' - 'numOfWomenDressSizeCeilBoundary'
  }```
- ^ this
  - repeats
  - until dateTime reaches a "good" non-approximate mean numeral
  - to accurately express the value of the TBA ordered dress
  - that is going to be 'L' for sizing
  - by the scaling for 'Womens Dress Sizing'
- Ie
  - it is in fact an actual

    "size 6"

    ||

    us size 6
